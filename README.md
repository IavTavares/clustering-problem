### The Locations clustering POC
Locations clustering proof-of-concept test task.

Given that we have a dataset which has around 60k of location addresses, including city, road, house_number, postcode and state: [Locations dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11sPSrssE39CPN73amoFvzosuAJpjyBqG/view?usp=sharing)

The data look like this:

The candidate is expected to create a solution - a proof of concept, using Python, to cluster (or simply group) those addresses where they belong to the same location. Candidate is free to use any machine learning model, or hand-crafting solutions to show how the candidate would approach to solve this problem.

Instructions:
 - Clone this repo or create a new public GitHub repo for the solution.
 - The solution will open/read the location data CSV file and write the grouped/clustered result in a result CSV file.
 - There's no restriction on how the candidate would choose to approach the problem.

Please email to: long@shake.io if you have any questions.

Good luck!
